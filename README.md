# Metal Archives Tweaks

This repository contains a collection of useful userscripts to enhance the experience on [Metal Archives](https://www.metal-archives.com/). These tweaks allow you to perform various actions such as expanding all lyrics with a single click or hiding specific elements on the site for a cleaner experience.

## Userscripts

### 1. **Expand All Lyrics** ([install](https://github.com/NikoboiNFTB/Metal-Archives-Tweaks/raw/refs/heads/main/expand-all-lyrics-1.3.user.js))

This userscript enables you to expand all track lyrics on a Metal Archives album page with a simple Shift + Click on any "Show lyrics" button. It also allows you to close all lyrics when clicked again.

### 2. **Hide Elements** ([install](https://github.com/NikoboiNFTB/Metal-Archives-Tweaks/raw/refs/heads/main/hide-elements-1.1.user.js))
